# REGRESSION PROJECTS
## What is regression analysis and what does it mean to perform a regression?

Regression analysis is a reliable method of identifying which variables have impact on a topic of interest. The process of performing a regression allows you to confidently determine which factors matter most, which factors can be ignored, and how these factors influence each other.

In order to understand regression analysis fully, it’s essential to comprehend the following terms:

    Dependent Variable: This is the main factor that you’re trying to understand or predict. 
    Independent Variables: These are the factors that you hypothesize have an impact on your dependent variable.

## Roadmap
++++++++++++ A STAR IS APPRECIATED++++++++++++++++++
Before we jump right into programming, we should lay out a brief guide to keep us on track. The following steps form the basis for any machine learning workflow once we have a problem and model in mind:

    1.State the question and determine required data
    2.Acquire the data in an accessible format
    3.Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies as required
    4.Prepare the data for the machine learning model
    5.Establish a baseline model that you aim to exceed
    6.Train the model on the training data
    7.Make predictions on the test data
    8.Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance metrics
    9.If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or try a different modeling technique
    10.Interpret model and report results visually and numerically
